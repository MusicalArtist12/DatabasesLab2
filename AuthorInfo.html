            <h1>About the Author</h1>
            <p>I decided against turning in my actual website found at <a href="https://Juliaviolet.dev">Juliaviolet.dev</a> since it uses Next.JS, a React Framework. I also do not want to add a useless login/logout page or a map to my contact page. There's also no Terms/Conditions, Privacy Policy, or Cookie Policy on it because they would be superfluous pages. If you really want to see the extent of my web development abilities go there.</p>

            <p>This was made for a lab assignment for CS3600 - Database Systems for the Fall 2025 semester at the University of Idaho. It was made with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
